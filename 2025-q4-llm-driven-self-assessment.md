### üß≠ Performance Review Self-Assessment (STAR Framework)

| **Dimension**                                           | **Situation**                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Task**                                                                                                                                     | **Action**                                                                                                                                                                              | **Result**                                                                                                             | **Self-assessment / Next Step**                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Architecture Documentation (‚úÖ strong)**               | While onboarding to a complex django + GCP + Hotwire platform with limited system visibility, there was a lack of up-to-date architecture documentation.                                       | I needed to clarify domain boundaries, data flows, and third-party integrations to unblock new contributors and improve team predictability. | Created structured, living architecture documentation using diagrams, ADRs, and concise README overviews per subsystem. Made sure each change in system behavior was reflected in docs. | New contributors onboarded 30‚Äì40% faster; discussions shifted from ‚Äúhow does it work?‚Äù to ‚Äúhow can we improve it?‚Äù     | **Keep standardizing documentation format and link it to CI/CD (e.g., architecture-as-code). Mentor others to document system intent, not just implementation.**                           |
| **Small Feature Implementation (‚ö†Ô∏è needs improvement)** | During the last iteration, I focused on small scope features (e.g., minor API additions, tweaks in eligibility rules). Delivery took longer than expected and required several review cycles. | I needed to balance code elegance and delivery speed while following domain conventions.                                                     | Spent excessive time polishing abstractions; didn‚Äôt validate early with PM/QA. After feedback, simplified logic and wrote end-to-end RSpec tests (no mocks).                            | Feature merged successfully but late. Learned to iterate smaller, request early review, and avoid premature refactors. | **Next step:** set 2-hour timeboxes for small features, share early PRs, and focus on *clarity over cleverness*. Validate design with team before coding.                                  |
| **Team Communication (‚ö†Ô∏è needs improvement)**           | After several intense weeks, I went silent for three days without communicating context, blocking coordination.                                                                               | Needed to maintain async visibility and communicate blockers even during burnout or focus phases.                                            | On reflection, prepared a ‚Äústatus hygiene‚Äù checklist ‚Äî Slack updates, task notes, handover context. Started using lightweight async updates (daily 2-liner summary).                    | Team feedback improved; regained trust through transparent recovery.                                                   | **Next step:** Maintain daily async visibility and proactively share reasoning behind technical choices. Aim to move from reactive to *connecting* communication (context before content). |
| **Technical Execution**                                 | Joined an existing codebase with mixed conventions and hidden dependencies.                                                                                                                   | Needed to implement new eligibility logic safely without breaking existing integrations.                                                     | Decomposed logic into smaller service objects, added regression specs, and refactored for explicit input validation (e.g., invalid JSON handling).                                      | Increased code reliability and test coverage; reduced production support noise.                                        | **Next step:** Focus on *delivery predictability* ‚Äî clarify Definition of Done, measure cycle time, and track technical debt systematically.                                               |
| **Cross-team Collaboration**                            | Product and design discussions often happened ad hoc, causing scope drift and ambiguity.                                                                                                      | Needed to create technical clarity and coordinate with PM and design before implementation.                                                  | Began initiating pre-dev syncs and wrote ‚Äútech preview notes‚Äù in PRs summarizing business logic decisions.                                                                              | Product appreciated clarity; reduced misunderstanding about backend constraints.                                       | **Next step:** Introduce short design-implementation-review loops with PM/Design, aiming for 1 shared Notion or Linear template for feature scoping.                                       |
| **Ownership & Initiative**                              | Observed misalignment between platform direction (Hetzner self-hosted AI) and team‚Äôs cloud-first approach.                                                                            | Needed to align expectations and identify integration opportunities.                                                                         | Facilitated async proposal outlining trade-offs between GCP and self-hosted GPU setups. Brought clarity to next steps.                                                                  | Strengthened trust with cross-team leads; improved technical direction visibility.                                     | **Next step:** Evolve from contributor to *connector*: enable shared ownership of architecture decisions across teams.                                                                     |
