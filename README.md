# Introduction
Hello, I'm Petro aka PK! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Product Engineer focused on backend, living in [Myrhorod, Ukraine](https://goo.gl/maps/J2bcjYx8VnM63ZfeA?coh=178571&entry=tt). Let's chat about `#workwarbalance`, `#neurodiversity`, `#playbacktheatre`, `#predictability`, and `#radicaltransparency`. ðŸ“« Reach me at +380674990373, @ortepko on TG, or [book a call](https://calendly.com/petrokoriakin1/talk-to-petro?back=1&month=2024-08). Anonymous feedback form: [link](https://forms.gle/j9dPdXYgV4qe4o246). I'm feedback-driven and detail-oriented, with a focus on smart workarounds and boring solutions. I value direct, actionable feedback. I specialize in Git, Ruby, and RSpec. I perform in [playback theatre](https://dou.ua/lenta/articles/dou-hobby-playback/) on weekends. Iâ€™ve worked with [kottans.org](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEK9H5bICxvoiDKQ7epRpxUDmQotmvsgM). Passionate about ["Go Scrum Yourself"](https://goscrumyourself.carrd.co/), UPMAâ“‡, and [ALKOframework](https://gitlab.com/nowhere-inc/tech-ninjas/alkoframework). My favorite sport is squash: commit squashing.
